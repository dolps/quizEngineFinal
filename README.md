# Java exam 2016 News Application

The project is divided into three main modules
backend, frontend and report.

# backend
The backend module is seperated into annotations, entity, repository and service packages, divided
by their respective layer(purpose), i chose to use the repository abstraction, since it made
it easier to reuse the code and made a better seperation between logic and persistence, actually
inspired by this talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvjdyqZR2CA

persistence configuration and DI can be found under resources

# frontend
The frontend consists of two main parts the controllers which backs up the JSF, and the jsf
itself. Each page with its respective controller.

http://localhost:8080/pg5100_exam

# report

mvn clean install, and mvn clean verify can be
executed directly from the root module
